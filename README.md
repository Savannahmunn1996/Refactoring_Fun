# Refactoring_Fun

## Description

This was a webpage for a social media marketing company that needed to be refactored. As a developer, It was my job to identify errors and any issues. I was able to make the code slightly more efficient.

- I learned quite a bit about semantic HTML tags while refactoring this code.

## Usage

This website is designed to be a place for clients searching for help with social media management. There are three sections to choose from based on the client's needs. Any link clicked in the navigation bar will prompt the UI to scroll to the respective area on the webpage.
